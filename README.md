## ‚òïÔ∏è Project Description

Brewm helps users find nearby spaces to get their caffeine fix as they work and study. Based on the entered location, the app will display a list of places categorized as cafes or spots serving coffee or tea. These results are conveniently sorted by distance and can be filtered by price. Each cafe is linked to its own page of available information, including photos, an address, business hours, and contact information.

Have a look around: https://brewm.netlify.app
