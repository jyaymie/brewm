# Brewm

## ☕️ Project Description

Brewm helps users find nearby cafes where they can work and study. Based on the entered location, the app will display a list of places automatically filtered as cafes (or spaces serving your much needed pick-me-up) and conveniently sorted by distance. Each cafe is linked to its own page of information that includes available photos, an address, business hours, and contact information.

Have a look around: https://brewm.netlify.app

## 👩‍💻 Technologies

- This is a front-end React application that utilizes JSX, React Router, and React-Bootstrap.
- Data was fetched from the Yelp Fusion API through a Heroku proxy server, which served as a workaround for CORS errors.

1.  Sign up for a free Yelp Fusion API key here: https://fusion.yelp.com/
2.  Fork and clone this project.
    `git clone https://github.com/your_username/Project-Name.git`
3.  Change into the new directory.

4.  Install the project dependencies with `npm install` and open the project.
5.  Safely store your API key by adding an `.env.local` file in the project root directory and, inside the file, replacing the default text with `REACT_APP_YELP_KEY=YourYelpFusionAPIKey`.
6.  Run your server with `npm run start` and start brewin' up a coding storm!
