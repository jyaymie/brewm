## ‚òïÔ∏è Project Description

Brewm helps users find nearby cafes where they can work and study. Based on the entered location, the app will display a list of places automatically categorized as cafes or spaces serving your much needed pick-me-up. These results are conveniently sorted by distance and can be filtered by price. Each cafe is linked to its own page of information that includes available photos, an address, business hours, and contact information.
